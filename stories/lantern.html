<h1>The Lantern of Luminous Dreams</h1>
<p>
    In a small village nestled at the foot of the Misty Mountains, there was
    a curious tradition: each child, upon turning sixteen, was given a
    lantern. But these weren't ordinary lanterns. They were said to hold the
    power to reveal a person’s deepest, unspoken dream whenever lit under
    the new moon.
</p>
<p>
    Mira had grown up hearing the stories, but like most teenagers, she
    thought it was all just a fairy tale. Until, on the night of her
    sixteenth birthday, she was handed her own lantern by the village elder.
    It was ancient, its brass exterior intricately carved with symbols she
    couldn't understand. As she held it, a strange warmth spread through her
    fingers, and for a moment, she felt as though the lantern pulsed in her
    hands, alive.
</p>
<p>
    The elder’s words echoed in her mind: "Light it only when the moon is
    hidden, and it will reveal what your heart truly seeks."
</p>
<p>
    Curious but skeptical, Mira placed the lantern by her bedside, resolving
    to ignore the odd tradition. But that night, as the new moon rose high
    and the village slumbered, Mira woke with an overwhelming urge to light
    the lantern. The room was so dark it felt like the shadows were pressing
    in from all sides, but she could see the faint outline of the lantern,
    almost glowing on its own.
</p>
<p>She lit the wick.</p>
<p>
    As soon as the flame flickered to life, it wasn’t just light that filled
    the room—but memories, dreams, and forgotten whispers. The walls around
    her dissolved, and she found herself standing in a place she'd never
    been before: a magnificent city made of glass and gold, floating above a
    sea of stars.
</p>
<p>
    In this city, people moved like shadows, weightless and free. And among
    them, Mira saw someone familiar—a young boy, with a laugh she recognized
    deep in her soul. It was her brother, Soren. Except Soren had
    disappeared five years ago. Everyone had assumed he was lost to the
    wilds beyond the village, but here he was, alive, in this ethereal
    place.
</p>
<p>
    Mira tried to call out, but her voice was swallowed by the dream-world’s
    silence. She ran toward him, her heart pounding, but the closer she got,
    the more the city began to fade. The stars around her flickered, and
    just as her fingers grazed the edge of Soren’s sleeve, the vision
    vanished.
</p>
<p>
    Mira found herself back in her room, her breath shallow, her heart
    racing, the lantern burning low. She knew now: Soren wasn’t gone. He was
    trapped in that city of dreams, somewhere beyond the world she knew.
</p>
<p>And she had to find him.</p>
